This version comes with a fundamental structural update. The user experience stays the same, but under the hood the whole loading and displaying structure has changed.\
This will be noticeable in better performance, especially when dealing with many files.

Improvements:
- Better performance when loading big number of files. The load process doesn't freeze the GUI anymore but updates it while the process is ongoing.
- Saving and loading hash files is not deserialized to the file notes themselves to be more memory efficient.

Bug fixes
- Fix installer for linux and macOS.
